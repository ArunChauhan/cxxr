    /** @brief Serialization/deserialization of pointers to GCNode objects.
     *
     * This class, all of whose members are static, provides the
     * mechanism by which pointers to objects inheriting from GCNode
     * should be serialized and deserialized.
     *
     * boost::serialization includes mechanisms for ensuring that if,
     * before serialization, several pointers to be serialized point
     * to the same object of a class type, then after deserialization,
     * the deserialized pointers will also all point to a single
     * object.  During deserialization, boost::serialization creates
     * this object using the appropriate <tt>operator new</tt> when
     * the first pointer of the group is deserialized; subsequent
     * pointers of the group are then simply set to point to that
     * object.
     *
     * However, in the CXXR application of boost::serialization, there
     * is a complication in that by the time the previous user session
     * is deserialized, the interpreter will already have partially
     * established the GCNode-GCEdge graph.  It will, for example,
     * already have set up the base environment, and defined many
     * Symbol and BuiltInFunction objects.  It is necessary that the
     * GCNode graph read from an archive is integrated correctly with
     * this pre-existing graph.  It is important, for example, that
     * pointers that pointed to the NA string in the previous session
     * are deserialized to point to the NA string already established
     * in the new session prior to deserialization (whereas, left to
     * itself, boost::serialization would be apt to make them point to
     * a \e duplicate of that string read from the archive).
     *
     * The way CXXR handles this is that whenever a non-null pointer
     * to an object of a class inheriting from GCNode is deserialized,
     * class GCNode::PtrS11n (specifically the templated function
     * GCNode::PtrS11n::invoke()) will call the function
     * S11nScope::relocate() on the pointer value.  This function will
     * use a look-up table within the innermost S11nScope.  If this
     * function returns a null pointer, then this signifies that no
     * special handling is required, and the pointer being
     * deserialized is left unchanged from the value given to it by
     * boost deserialization.
     *
     * However, if S11nScope::relocate() returns a non-null pointer
     * <tt>p</tt>, this signifies that the pointer value yielded by
     * boost deserialization needs to be replaced by <tt>p</tt>.  For
     * example suppose that in the previous session a particular
     * pointer pointed to the NA string.  When that pointer is
     * deserialized, boost::deserialization will create a String
     * object <tt>s</tt> which is merely a \e proxy for the NA string;
     * however, invoking S11nScope::relocate() on the address of that
     * object will return a pointer to the new session's NA string.
     * GCNode::PtrS11n::invoke() will make the pointer being
     * deserialized point to that.
     *
     * Whenever one of these 'proxy' objects is deserialized, the
     * deserialization logic should create an appropriate entry in the
     * look-up table used by S11nScope::relocate() by calling
     * S11nScope::defineRelocation().  Once that is done, there is no
     * need to retain the proxy object, and S11nScope::defineRelocation() will
     * automatically expose it to garbage collection.
     *
     * Note that proxy objects may be malformed, i.e. violate the
     * invariants of their class: no use should be made of them.
