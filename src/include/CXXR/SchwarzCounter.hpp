    /** @brief Schwarz counter.
     *
     * The Schwarz counter (see for example Stephen C. Dewhurst's book
     * 'C++ Gotchas') is a programming idiom to ensure that a class \a
     * T (including particularly its static members) is initialized
     * before any client of the class requires to use it, and that on
     * program exit the class's static resources are not cleaned up
     * prematurely (e.g. while the class is still in use by another
     * class's static members).  Devices such as this are necessitated
     * by the fact that the standard does not prescribe the order in
     * which objects of file and global scope in different compilation
     * units are initialized: it specifies only that the order of
     * destruction must be the reverse of the order of initialization.
     *
     * The necessary control is achieved by the unusual stratagem of
     * including the \e definition of a lightweight data item within
     * the header file of class \a T.  This data item is of type
     * SchwarzCounter<T>, and is declared within an anonymous
     * namespace.  Each file that <tt>\#include</tt>s this header file
     * will therefore include a definition of a SchwarzCounter object,
     * and this definition will precede any data definitions within
     * the enclosing file that depend on class \a T.  Consequently,
     * the SchwarzCounter object will be constructed before any data
     * objects of the client file.  The constructor of SchwarzCounter
     * is so defined that when the first such object is created, the
     * class MemoryBank will itself be initialized.
     *
     * Conversely, when the program exits, data items within each
     * client file will have their destructors invoked before the
     * file's SchwarzCounter object has its destructor invoked.  This
     * SchwarzCounter destructor is so defined that only when the last
     * SchwarzCounter object is destroyed is class \a T itself cleaned
     * up.
     *
     * @tparam T class whose initialization and clean-up are to be
     *           controlled by the Schwarz counter.  This class must
     *           defined static methods <tt>initialize()</tt> and
     *           <tt>cleanup()</tt>, capable of being invoked with no
     *           parameters.
