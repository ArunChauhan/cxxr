     * control the behaviour of deserialization.  It is mandatory that
     * any use of boost::serialization to deserialize GCNode objects
     * takes place within the lifetime of a S11nScope object.
     *
     * One function of this class is to manage relocation during
     * deserialization, as described for class GCNode::PtrS11n .  This
     * is achieved using the functions defineRelocation() and
     * relocate().
     *
     * S11nScope objects are intended to be allocated on the processor
     * stack: specifically, the class implementation requires that
     * S11nScope objects are destroyed in the reverse order of
     * creation, and the destructor checks this.
