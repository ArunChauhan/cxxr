## Usage:
##   R CMD Rdiff from-file to-file exitstatus
## where from-file equal to '-' means STDIN

ffile=${1}
tfile=${2}
exitstatus=${3}

## sed scripts to get rid of the startup message
scriptold='/^R : Copyright /,/quit R.$/{d;}'
scriptnew='/^R version /,/quit R.$/{d;}'
s1="s/‘/'/g"
s2="s/’/'/g"

## egrep pattern to get rid of some more
## <= 2.2.x was pattern='(^Number of.*:|^Time |^Loading required package.*'
pattern='(CXXR|^Time |^Loading required package.*|^Package [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]+ loaded'
