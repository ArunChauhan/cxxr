 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *   Computes the negative binomial distribution. For integer n,
 *   this is probability of x failures before the nth success in a
 *   sequence of Bernoulli trials. We do not enforce integer n, since
 *   the distribution is well defined for non-integers,
 *   and this can be useful for e.g. overdispersed discrete survival times.
