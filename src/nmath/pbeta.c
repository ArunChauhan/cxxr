 *  SYNOPSIS

 *
 * double pbeta_raw(double x, double pin, double qin, int lower_tail, int log_p)
 * double pbeta	   (double x, double pin, double qin, int lower_tail, int log_p)
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *	Returns distribution function of the beta distribution.
 *	( = The incomplete beta ratio I_x(p,q) ).
 *
 *  NOTES
 *
 *      As from R 2.3.0, a wrapper for TOMS708
 *      as from R 2.6.0, 'log_p' partially improved over log(p..)
