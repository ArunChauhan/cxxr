 *  SYNOPSIS
 *
 *    #include <Rmath.h>
 *    double sign(double x);
 *
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *
 *    This function computes the  'signum(.)' function:
 *
 *    	sign(x) =  1  if x > 0
 *    	sign(x) =  0  if x == 0
 *    	sign(x) = -1  if x < 0
 */

#include "nmath.h"

double sign(double x)
{
    if (ISNAN(x))
	return x;
    return ((x > 0) ? 1 : ((x == 0)? 0 : -1));
}
