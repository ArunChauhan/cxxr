 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 *   Computes the density of the gamma distribution,
 *
 *                   1/s (x/s)^{a-1} exp(-x/s)
 *        p(x;a,s) = -----------------------
 *                            (a-1)!
 *
 *   where `s' is the scale (= 1/lambda in other parametrizations)
 *     and `a' is the shape parameter ( = alpha in other contexts).
 *
 * The old (R 1.1.1) version of the code is available via `#define D_non_pois'
