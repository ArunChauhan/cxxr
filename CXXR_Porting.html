<h1>C++ R Engine: Porting Guide</h1>

<p>This document gives guidance on porting R code and C packages to work with
CXXR.</p>

<h2>R Code</h2>

<p>In general, if R code behaves differently under CXXR and under CR (in the
release of CR on which this release of CXXR is based), then that is a bug in
CXXR: please report it. However, differences in timing and in space
consumption are to be expected.</p>

<p>Also, there may be differences in the behaviour of R functions which probe
into the implementation of the interpreter. In particular:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>gc()</code> now returns different quantities, in the form of a
    vector with four rows and two columns: see the revised help page.</li>
  <li>Although <code>mem.limits(nsize, vsize)</code> retains the same
    interface, the interpretation of the quantities involved has changed
    somewhat; likewise the corresponding command-line options to R. See the
    revised Memory help page for details.</li>
  <li>Memory profiling, as accessed <em>via</em> <code>Rprofmem</code> in
    package <code>utils</code>, has not (yet) been properly reengineered for
    CXXR, and the relevant code has not been tested. Do not rely on the
    existing behaviour to persist.</li>
  <li>The function <code>memory.profile()</code> performs no useful function
    in CXXR: it simply returns a vector of zeroes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Moreover, while CXXR is at an alpha/beta development stage, internal logic
errors (i.e. errors due to bugs in the interpreter rather than to bugs in the
R code it is interpreting) will sometimes cause the interpreter itself to
terminate, even in circumstances where CR would manage to recover to the
top-level prompt. This is intentional in order to 'preserve the scene of
crime' for debugging.</p>

<h2>C Code</h2>

<h3>Mandatory changes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><code>R_NilValue</code> in CXXR is simply a null pointer, rather than a
    pointer to a real object. To smooth this change, the following changes
    have been made to accessor functions: 
    <ul>
      <li><code>CAR</code>, <code>CDR</code>, <code>TAG</code> and
        <code>ATTRIB</code> each return a null pointer if passed a null
        pointer.</li>
      <li><code>OBJECT</code> and <code>IS_S4_OBJECT</code> each return
        <code>FALSE</code> if passed a null pointer.</li>
      <li><code>LENGTH</code> and <code>NAMED</code> each return 0 if passed
        a null pointer.</li>
      <li><code>SET_NAMED</code> is a no-op if the first argument is a null
        pointer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>However, other accessor functions are likely to crash if invoked for
    <code>R_NilValue</code>: the calling code should introduce appropriate
    checks and workarounds.</p>
  </li>
  <li><code>SEXPTYPE</code> is now an enumeration, rather than being
    <code>typedef</code>ed to <code>unsigned int</code>, but the numerical
    values of particular <code>SEXPTYPE</code>s are unchanged. (This change
    appears to have been under comtemplation within CR.) This may necessitate
    some explicit conversions or changes in the types of variables.</li>
  <li>C code that calls (directly or indirectly) certain CXXR internal
    functions that are now implemented in C++ should be compiled in such a
    way that C++ exceptions are propagated correctly. For example, using
    <code>gcc</code> this can be achieved by specifying the compiler flag
    <code>-fexceptions</code>. The most likely case where this will be
    necessary is in code that calls <code>error</code> (aka
    <code>Rf_error</code>); without this change, the R interpreter may not
    return correctly to the top-level R prompt following an error.</li>
  <li>CXXR requires that when <code>UNPROTECT</code> or
    <code>REPROTECT</code> are applied to a pointer, this is carried out in
    the same context (<code>RCNTXT</code>) as that in which the pointer was
    <code>PROTECT</code>ed. This is to help pick up mispairing between
    <code>PROTECT</code> and <code>UNPROTECT</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Suggested changes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Redesignate your code as C++ :-) : this will enable more functions to
    be inlined, and open the way to future benefits. At the very least,
    remove features of your code that gratuitously prevent it being compiled
    by a C++ compiler: identifiers called <code>this</code> or
    <code>class</code>, for example. But remember to use <code>extern
    "C"</code> appropriately in your header files, to prevent C++ mangling of
    the names of functions intended to be visible to C code.</li>
  <li>Rework code as necessary to prevent compiler warnings that a
    <code>const</code> qualifier is being discarded.</li>
</ul>

<h2>FORTRAN Code</h2>

<h3>Mandatory changes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>FORTRAN code that calls (directly or indirectly) certain CXXR internal
    functions that are now implemented in C++ should be compiled in such a
    way that C++ exceptions are propagated correctly. For example, using
    <code>gfortran</code> this can apparently be achieved by specifying the
    compiler flag <code>-fexceptions</code> (though it is not well
    documented). The most likely case where this will be necessary is in code
    that calls <code>rexit</code>; without this change, the R interpreter may
    not return correctly to the top-level R prompt following an error.</li>
</ul>

<h2>C++ Code</h2>

<p>The question of providing additional facilities for external packages
written in C++ has not yet been addressed. In particular, although it is
intended that in the future such packages will be able to make use of the
classes defined in namespace <code>CXXR</code>, the interfaces are in too
much flux at present for this to be advisable.</p>

sufficient knowledge of C++, please contact <a
